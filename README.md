# 🧠 AS91906 & AS91907 Combined Project – GUI Application

This repository contains your individual project for the combined assessment of:

- **AS91906 v2** – Apply knowledge of complex concepts in developing a computer program (Level 3)  
- **AS91907 v2** – Use complex processes to develop a digital technologies outcome (Level 3)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

You will design, develop, test, and evaluate a **GUI-based software application** using **Python with Tkinter** (or another approved GUI framework). Your application must meet a real-world need and demonstrate your ability to apply complex programming techniques while managing the project through effective planning, version control, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Assessment Goals

### You will be assessed on:

🔹 **AS91906 – Programming**
- Applying complex programming concepts (e.g. collections, modular design, file I/O)
- Creating a GUI that responds to user interaction and input
- Testing/debugging your program (expected, boundary, and invalid cases)
- Writing clean, well-commented, PEP8-compliant code
- Structuring your program logically and efficiently
- Developing a functional and purposeful software solution

🔹 **AS91907 – Project Management**
- Planning using a Gantt chart or Trello
- Decomposing the outcome into smaller components
- Trialling and selecting suitable components or techniques
- Using Git and version control effectively
- Addressing relevant implications (e.g. IP, accessibility, usability)
- Reflecting on planning, trialling, and testing to refine your outcome

## 🛠️ Tools to Use

You are expected to use the following tools during development:

- [x] Python 3 with Tkinter (or another GUI framework)
- [x] Git + GitHub (this repo)
- [x] Trello (or Gantt chart) for project planning
- [x] draw.io for wireframes
- [x] Google Forms for user testing/feedback

---

## 🔄 Development Process

You will complete your project in **3 sprints**:

1. **Sprint 1**: Define the need, initial wireframes, MVP functionality  
2. **Sprint 2**: Trial features, add advanced functionality, collect feedback  
3. **Sprint 3**: Final testing, polish, address implications, evaluate

---

## ✅ Submission Requirements

To meet the standard, your repository must contain:

- ✅ Python program demonstrating complex techniques and GUI functionality  
- ✅ Evidence of planning and decomposition (Trello or Gantt)  
- ✅ Trialling and testing documentation  
- ✅ Feedback results and decisions made from testing  
- ✅ Reflections and evaluation using PALS structure  
- ✅ Documented implications (e.g. IP, ethics, accessibility)
